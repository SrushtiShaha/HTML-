            <p class="p1">Cafes looking to maximise their seating capacity need a strategy that strikes a balance between 
                customer comfort and increasing profit. With more customers seated throughout the day you can enjoy a higher
                turnover of tables for every service, supported by an appropriate layout that adds to the design.The comfort
                aspect is directly related to the amount of space you have and ensuring you do not overcrowd. Of course, 
                the furniture needs to be comfortable, but comfort also means giving customers enough of their own personal
                space to relax and enjoy the service. Also think about how the seating arrangements affect the interior design 
                and how they can complement each other.</p>

                <p class="p1">The Dining room is the heart of any restaurant and the first area visitors interact with. Strict
                    cleanliness and hygiene protocols must be followed in this area. This not only ensures the safety of the customers 
                    but helps build trust with the people dining at the restaurant.It is not just the food and hospitality that attracts 
                    a customer to a hotel or restaurant space. Moreover, the customer is drawn more to the environment, ambience, decor 
                    and overall cleanliness and hygiene the restaurant space offers.Finally, training your housekeeping staff will not 
                    only give them a sense of understanding on how to organise and structure to perfection but will train them to do it 
                    quickly and efficiently. </p>

                    <p class="p1" >We founded <span class="s2"> Foodie - Shoodie </span>in January of 2012. In October 2014, not quite 3 years later, our team reached a
                        significant milestone – the $1million sales mark; qualifying us for membership in the Envato Power Elite program. 
                        Who are we? How did we accomplish such a remarkable sales feat in so short a time?
                        Our team consists of a graphic designer, a coder, a programmer, and a jack-of-all trades support guy. 
                        We live and work in Poland. We’ve worked together for a number of years, but our turning point came in 2012, 
                        when we hooked up with ThemeForest.  
                        We believe our accomplishments are a result of hard work, team spirit, and a determination to constantly improve
                        upon our products.
                        Our name? There’s  symbolic about <span class="s2"> Foodie - Shoodie</span>. We made it up for Foodies and we designed a logo to match.</p>
